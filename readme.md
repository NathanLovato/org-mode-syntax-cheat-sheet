Org-Mode Syntax Cheat-Sheet
===========================

A document `cheat_sheet.org` showing the most important aspects of Org-mode
syntax.  It is adapted from an example of Org syntax in the article
[Org-Mode Is One of the Most Reasonable Markup Language to Use for
Text](http://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only/) by Karl Voit.

Contents
---------

* `cheat_sheet.org`: The cheat-sheet (an Org-mode file). If you are viewing
   it on GitHub make sure to click "Raw", as GitHub automatically
   interprets and formats Org files.

* `cheat_sheet.html`: The cheat-sheet exported to an html file.

* `cheat_sheet.txt`: The cheat-sheet exported to a txt file.

* `cheat_sheet.tex`: The cheat-sheet exported to a LaTeX file.

* `cheat_sheet.pdf`: A PDF cheat-sheet produced from the LateX file.

* `cheat_sheet_pandoc.html`: Version exported by Pandoc.

* `cheat_sheet_pandoc.txt`: Version exported by Pandoc.

* `cheat_sheet_pandoc.tex`: Version exported by Pandoc.

* `cheat_sheet_pandoc.pdf`: Version exported by Pandoc.

Note
----

The exported files were produced in Emacs using
the `org-export-dispatch` command (C-c C-e) or,
for the files with `_pandoc` at the end of their name,
by Pandoc with a call such as
`pandoc -s cheat_sheet.org -o cheat_sheet_pandoc.html`.

GitHub renders the Org file.
Click "Raw" to see it in its original plain text form.
